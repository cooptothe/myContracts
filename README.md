# My Smart Contracts

I've embarked on an exciting journey of creating and deploying my own smart contracts with a focus on blockchain technology. Thanks to the powerful ThirdWeb framework, this process has become more streamlined and efficient.

## What I've Accomplished

To kickstart my project, I utilized the following example to create a project with the necessary structure:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --contract --template forge-starter
```

With this foundation in place, I've started modifying the `contracts/Contract.sol` file, customizing it to suit my unique needs and ideas. This is where the magic happens, and I get to express my creativity by defining the logic and functionality of my smart contracts.

## Leveraging the Power of ThirdWeb Contracts Package

To enhance the functionality of my smart contracts, I've harnessed the capabilities of the `@thirdweb-dev/contracts` package. This package provides me with a set of base contracts and extensions to inherit, making it easier to implement complex features and interactions in my contracts.

## Building and Deploying

After making changes to my smart contracts, I run the following commands to compile and prepare them for deployment:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This step is crucial for ensuring the contracts are correctly compiled and ready for deployment on the blockchain.

## Taking My Contracts Live

When I'm satisfied with my smart contracts and ready to bring them to life on the blockchain, I use one of the following commands to deploy them:

```bash
npm run deploy
# or
yarn deploy
```

This marks the moment when my smart contracts become fully operational, ready to interact with users and other applications in the blockchain ecosystem.

## Sharing My Innovation

In the spirit of innovation and collaboration, I have the option to release a version of my contracts publicly. This allows me to share my work with the community and potentially inspire others. To do this, I use one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run release
# or
yarn release
```

By taking this step, I contribute to the broader blockchain development community and demonstrate my commitment to pushing the boundaries of what smart contracts can achieve.
